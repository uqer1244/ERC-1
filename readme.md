# Vireon 42 Split

The vireon 42 is a wireless 42-key choc v1 split that uses a Corne-like layout with a promicro.
It supports OLED and is wireless, so it doesn't use a TRRS cable. (thinking of making a option in v2)

## Design Goals

- Low cost
- Extensibility
- Simplicity
- Portability
- Unique designs
- Wireless
- OLED displays

The PCB is reversible to reduce manufacturing costs. 

The six EX1 ~ EX6 pins allow direct attachment of ZMK-compatible modules.

42keys are easy to adapt.

## Firmware

Using zmk and I'm still working on it

## What you need
